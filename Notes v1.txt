V1 boards ordered w/ 2oz copper.
First assembly was a bit tough at 400C the copper planes suck up heat. 
Next assembly will try preheating PCB with heat gun while soldering.

Changes to make
-10k resistors on schematic (no values on v1)

Assembly Order
 - Resistors
 - LEDs
 - 2x5 and 2x8 sockets, only 1/2 pins on CV/Gate lines (lower heat sink capacity)
 - Caps on +/- 12 Rails (lower heat sink capacity)
 - Finish soldering all pins
